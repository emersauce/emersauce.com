            <h3><i>Time Perception</i>, 2018-2019</h3>
            
<h2>Dec 9, 2018</h2>
<p>Time perception in varying environments.</p>

<h3>Goal:</h3>
<p>Perform a task (drawing, sitting still with eyes closed, etc.) for what I think is a 10-minute period. The point is to measure subjective time perception in different contexts over multiple sessions.</p>

<h3>Note on background music:</h3>
<p>This first day of experiments was admittedly haphazard and spontaneous. Music was playing while I started the first test, but it didn't demand my focus and was easily ignored. It was mostly instrumental and ambient-adjacent. If you're really curious here's a Spotify link to what I was listening to: <a href="https://spoti.fi/2UBlW6e">https://spoti.fi/2UBlW6e</a></p>

<h3>Sequence of tests:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>"Drawing" in Quill VR (with background music)</li>
  <li>Drawing on paper (with background music)</li>
  <li>Sitting still (with background music)</li>
  <li>Sitting still</li>
</ol>

<h3>Preventing awareness of "correct" time:</h3>
<p>My goal is to keep myself unaware of the actual duration of these sessions until I'm done with the full run of experiments. If I learn exactly how long I have been taking, I might subconsciously correct myself, which would measure my skill at mentally measuring ten-minute increments, but what I'm hoping to measure is any change in my perception of time in different environments and activities.</p>

<h3>Concealed time collection methods (12-9-18):</h3>
<p>I placed my phone on a table, opened its stopwatch feature, and pointed my webcam at the phone's screen. After I pressed "start," I covered the time readout with an object (a tube of Clorox wipes, to be specific.) I then began my given task. When I completed my task, I made sure the webcam was active, the phone was in view, and my cursor was on the shutter button. Then I closed my eyes, removed the object from the phone's screen to reveal the readout, and took the photo. I then took the file, named it according to the activity and the date, and stored it away. I squinted during the whole process for fear of catching a glimpse of the actual time.</p>

<h3>Note on time collection for 12-9-18:</h3>
<p>There were some moments throughout this process that I caught a glimpse of the time - Photo Booth (the webcam software) automatically names its files with a timestamp, and my mind "did the math" without my intention (nosy brain!) Now I know where those moments arise and can avoid them, but I will look into writing a program that allows me to measure time and store the data without displaying the time data itself.</p>

<h2>Detailed account of each test</h2>

<h4>"Drawing" in Quill VR (with background music)</h4>
<p>I started the timer and fumbled around with the headset and controllers for a moment. When I finally "got in," I started by trying to set up my environment: getting the floor to line up with the real world's so I could avoid motion sickness. I fiddled with that for a while and then started drawing. I didn't know what I was drawing at first, but I soon settled on a brain-y looking thing. The repetitive scribbles/squiggles don't demand the visual and mental scrutiny of observational drawing, and the only thing I was focused on was keeping the marks focused loosely into a brain shape. I realized that I was only making one hemisphere, so after what felt like about 5 minutes I started another half (in blue.) Soon after, I got the gut feeling that it had been about 10 minutes and ended the task.</p>
<p><em>Note on my mental state-</em> Throughout this process, the environment around me was changing orientation often and jerkily. My original floor setup long gone, I got nauseated, uncomfortable, and--most importantly--impatient.</p>

<h4>Drawing on paper (with background music)</h4>
<p>I started the timer and gathered some supplies. I thought about what to draw and decided to replicate in two dimensions what I had just drawn in three. I used the same scribbly/squiggly motion and the same shape as before, but drew a top-down view of the brain. Building the hemispheres was a time-sensing tool (zeitgeber) I used in the Quill drawing, so I decided it would be fine to use it here as well. After what felt like 5 minutes on the blue half, I switched to red. I had made less progress on the second hemisphere than the first, but that same gut feeling told me it was time to stop.</p>
<p><em>Note on the "gut feeling" method of time perception-</em> I usually don't have to think about the rate of time passing. If I need to know the time I can check a clock. The main parallel I can think of is anticipating when a microwave will beep so I can interrupt it just before the timer goes off and avoid hearing the loud alarm sound. In the case of the microwave, I usually just get what I can describe as a gut feeling that it's almost done. There is an aspect of this feeling that can be analyzed. When I am in the midst of a duration-related task, like waiting for the microwave to finish, I will query the memory of the moment I hit "start" and left the area. As time passes, when I recall the memory I get a sense of how much distance is between "now" and "then"-- when the memory was made. It's similar to driving past a landmark on a road and watching it shrink in a rearview mirror. The quality of that specific memory changes as the temporal gap between its creation and its recollection grows. I'm not sure whether I should use what this observation describes as a time-keeping device, or whether I should keep my mind in the present moment (not make memory queries) and wait for my mind to beep at me like a totally unpredictable microwave... Well, it's an idea for another experiment.</p>

<h4>Sitting still (with background music)</h4>
<p>I sat cross-legged on a rug and closed my eyes. I could call it meditation, but I didn't practice any specific technique that would relate it to meditation besides sitting still with my eyes closed. Instead, I just sat there. Since I'm explicating factors: I had my shoes on, which is different than what I'd normally do. I thought about food a lot. At this point in my study I was getting hungry, had to use the toilet, and was still a little nauseated. I was feeling good, though. I think it was during this task that I realized the music could make a difference. I found myself listening to the songs, which I hadn't done during the last two tasks. I found it much harder to know when to end the session during this task. I kept waiting and waiting because I felt it was too soon. I didn't get the "gut feeling" with as much assuredness as before. I finally ended the session when I felt like it may have been too long.</p>

<h4>Sitting still (no music)</h4>
<p>I sat the same way as before, this time without the music to entertain me. I felt comfortable--I no longer had to use the toilet and the nausea was gone. There was less worry about timing and I mostly thought about the things I would say in this document and the other homework I need to do. It's finals week--that's probably important to include. Without as much thought as the last session, I decided to end the sitting.</p>

<h2>Jan 9, 2019</h2>
<p>January 9th, 2019 around 9:30 pm KSE 551</p>

<p>Things that are different from last time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm using my PD patch, "Hidden Stopwatch" instead of that terrible webcam system.</li>
  <li>I'm doing the summaries of each activity immediately after instead of all at the end.</li>
  <li>I couldn't find a computer/rig in the lab, so this session was all outside of VR.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary of Activities</h3>
<ol>
  <li>sitting in silence, eyes closed: 0 11 30; (22:46pm) +90s</li>
</ol>
<p>My first measurement of 2019. I realized that there are even more ways I can mentally measure time that I originally thought. I can not think about time at all-- just do the "are we there yet" thing until it feels right. I can also think in increments. "Ok, so I've been here about two minutes, that means 8 more to go... it feels like 5 minutes have passed, halfway there." etc. One is more intuitive, the other relies on dissection. There is a spectrum, of course. This sit was more toward the intuitive side, but not completely. I wore shoes, sat criss-cross, and was pretty comfortable. I opened my eyes a couple of times and even bent forward and backward to stretch my back.</p>

<h4>doodling in silence: 0 7 49; -131s</h4>
<p>I tried the more intuitive approach with this one. Not experiencing time incrementally, just recalling the initial moment a few times to get a feeling for the time elapsed. Having something to do instead of sitting in relative isolation helps the intuitive approach: my moving hand and the mark-making process (nonrepresentational) were the focus, instead of the analysis of passing time.</p>

<p>sitting in silence, eyes closed pt.2: 0 8 10;</p>
<p>So I did it again, this time with the goal being to not analyze or count or anything. No mental tricks to measure time. It worked: I had no idea how much time was passing. It was a little bit disconcerting at first, but then I relaxed into the idea because that was the goal. I think it went kinda short, but it felt longish. Hard to say. After I felt time was up, I made the timestamp and then continued with the practice. I tried to regain that feeling of being free and "swimming" through time, and after a little while I did. Time really stretches in odd ways when there is nothing to ground myself with.</p>

<h2>Feb 3, 2019</h2>
<p>Feb 3, 2019</p>

<p>Today's context:</p>
<p>It's late Sunday night and I have a class in the morning that I still need to do homework for. Kind of anxious, but not very. Shoes off. Heater's going. 4 cups of non-caffeinated tea. I took breaks in between experiments, just long enough to "reset" and make sure I lost track of the exact time.</p>

<h4>Sitting 1: 0 10 39; +39 seconds</h4>
<p>In the swing of things. I did have to rename the text file mid-session because I forgot to before, and it needs to be correct before I record times. My mental measurement was more on the intuitive than analytical side, but there was still some subtle division of time.</p>

<h4>Drawing: 0 6 55; -185 s</h4>
<p>This was all intuitive. I got into the zone of scribbling, and lost track of time until my mental timer went off.</p>
<img src="IMG_8753.jpg" alt="Drawing">
  
<h4>Sitting 2: false alarm @ 0 8 58; final time 0 9 22; -38 seconds</h4>
<p>Around what in my mind was the 7-minute mark, I thought it was time. But it felt early, so I waited a while longer.</p>

<h2>Feb 23, 2019</h2>
<p>Feb 23, Friday (fact check the date; past midnight days bleed)</p>

<p>This was a one-off, at home. sitting at 1 am after a long day. Thinking of posture most of the time, and breathing, and time. Some reflection on the day, but only a little. Fresh out of the shower, thirsty, barefoot. 0 10 19; +19 seconds</p>

<h2>Feb 24, 2019</h2>
<p>Sunday, feb 24, 2019 (fact check the date; past midnight days bleed)</p>

<p>Past 12 am.</p>

<h4>Quill doodle: 0 9 0; -60 seconds.</h4>
<p>I was having a lot of fun, and I at one point I realized I had lost track of time. I was so into my doodle that I hesitated before ending the stopwatch because I was having so much fun. Which leads me to--</p>

<h4>(Analog) doodling: 0 10 42; +42 seconds</h4>
<p>It felt boring in comparison to what I was just doing-- my body being still and making small movements to pass time didn't seem too interesting. I kept trying to compare what the time felt like relative to my Quill time, but I really was getting nowhere with that, and I also tried to suppress those thoughts and keep each measurement as independent as possible. As far as drawing goes, I tried to translate the movements I was making in 3D into 2D.</p>

<h4>Sitting: 0 10 36; +36 seconds</h4>
<p>No panicky moments trying to "feel" the time. Overall pretty chill, maybe not accurate but it felt okay.</p>

<h2>Conclusion, 2024</h2>
<p>My most accurate guesses were consistently when I was sitting with eyes closed and no music (closest was 19 seconds past the mark). It's hard to distinguish any further than that with such a small sample. Ideally I would've had more VR sessions, but logistics became an issue.</p>

<p>This was a really enjoyable experiment to carry out. I became more familiar with my own sense of time, and there was something rewarding about taking this sense seriously enough to investigate it for a while.</p>

<p>In the not-too-distant future (it's February 2024) I hope to follow up on a question I had earlier: exploring the difference between using a time-keeping mental technique and using no time-keeping technique at all.</p>

<p>When I am in the midst of a duration-related task, like waiting for the microwave to finish, I will query the memory of the moment I hit "start" and left the area. As time passes, when I recall the memory I get a sense of how much distance is between "now" and "then"--when the memory was made. It's similar to driving past a landmark on a road and watching it shrink in a rearview mirror. The quality of that specific memory changes as the temporal gap between its creation and its recollection grows. I'm not sure whether I should use what this observation describes as a time-keeping device, or whether I should keep my mind in the present moment (not make memory queries) and wait for my mind to beep at me like a totally unpredictable microwave... Well, it's an idea for another experiment.</p>

<p>I think consistently maintaining each state of awareness will be enough of a challenge to keep me interested and trying. It'll be less about the accuracy to the "goal time" and more about getting some insights into these loose categories of curiosity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The quality of my perception of my perception of time in different circumstances</li>
  <li>Whether I can control if I attend to or ignore time's passing (without an external stimulus like drawing or even focusing on my breath)</li>
  <li>Whether the effort to maintain a technique (a sense of trying and failing) impacts the quality of time or my sense of time's duration</li>
  <li>Whether the successful maintenance of a technique (a sense of successfully using a technique without muddling it with the other or getting sidetracked) impacts the quality of/my measure of time</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not even sure if it's possible to ignore time's passing completely when the idea is to be done with the exercise in ten minutes. It's kind of an "instant death" situation, where if you have the thought "has it been ten minutes?", you've already sent the temporal query, which is muddling techniques... it's worth trying out, anyways!</p>
